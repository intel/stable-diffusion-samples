    "\n",
    "Try modifying the text prompt to generate different images. Here are some ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adjust the level of detail in your prompt (e.g., \"A detailed oil painting of a cat riding a blue surfboard on a massive wave at sunset\")\n",
    "- Try different artistic styles (e.g., \"A watercolor sketch of a cat surfing\")\n",
    "- Experiment with completely different subjects and scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Options\n",
    "\n",
    "For more control over the generation process, you can customize additional parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = pipe(\n",
    "    prompt=\"Your detailed prompt here\",\n",
    "    negative_prompt=\"low quality, blurry\",  # What you don't want to see\n",
    "    num_inference_steps=50,               # More steps = more detail but slower\n",
    "    guidance_scale=7.5                    # How closely to follow the prompt\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
