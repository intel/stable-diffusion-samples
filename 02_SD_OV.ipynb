    "# Text-to-Image Generation with Stable Diffusion and OpenVINO™\n",
    "\n",
    "Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image latent diffusion model created by the researchers and engineers from [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) and [LAION](https://laion.ai/). It is trained on 512x512 images from a subset of the [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) database. This model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts. With its 860M UNet and 123M text encoder.\n",
    "See the [model card](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "General diffusion models are machine learning systems that are trained to denoise random gaussian noise step by step, to get to a sample of interest, such as an image.\n",
    "Diffusion models have shown to achieve state-of-the-art results for generating image data. But one downside of diffusion models is that the reverse denoising process is slow. In addition, these models consume a lot of memory because they operate in pixel space, which becomes unreasonably expensive when generating high-resolution images. Therefore, it is challenging to train these models and also use them for inference. OpenVINO brings capabilities to run model inference on Intel hardware and opens the door to the fantastic world of diffusion models for everyone!\n",
    "\n",
    "Model capabilities are not limited text-to-image only, it also is able solve additional tasks, for example text-guided image-to-image generation and inpainting. This tutorial also considers how to run text-guided image-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to convert and run stable diffusion model using OpenVINO.\n",

    "As you can see from the diagram, the only difference between Text-to-Image and text-guided Image-to-Image generation in approach is how initial latent state is generated. In case of Image-to-Image generation, you additionally have an image encoded by VAE encoder mixed with the noise produced by using latent seed, while in Text-to-Image you use only noise as initial latent state.\n",

    "Next, the U-Net iteratively *denoises* the random latent image representations while being conditioned on the text embeddings. The output of the U-Net, being the noise residual, is used to compute a denoised latent image representation via a scheduler algorithm.
